Ryan Reynolds, Hugh Jackman, and director Shawn Levy approached this project with care and a deep understanding of what fans want.

But when the violence of oppressors meets the rage of the others, the contagion will explode from the trial-city borders and spread across the nation.\n\nThe Purge has come a long way since its inception. Originally used as nothing more than an excuse to explain away \"Why don't they just call the cops?\" in your average home-invasion movie, the original Purge movie had implied classism for the meat of it, and then an actual call to class division right at the end. Since then, the classism, and racism in American society has become a focal B-story to the Purge movies, and now we're in 2018 for the prequel - The First Purge - and those issues are now the whole point of the movie.

In order to save earth, young people once again have to step forward to start a race against time for life and death.\n\nNow then, it's best - I think - to just accept that there is very, very, little plausible science to this save-the-planet movie. The format, and the story, have oft been done by Hollywood before so it's not top of the originality tree either - but it's still quite a watchable and well produced story of a group of Chinese trainees who must raise their game when they find themselves trying to save the infrastructure being built to help save the planet from terrorists. It's extremely perilous for them, their enemy is sophisticated and well entrenched. When the moon becomes unstable, it again falls... read the rest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
